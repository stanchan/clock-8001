## Version 3.14.1
* BUGFIX: Clock scaling on the official 7" display

## Version 3.14.0
* Experimental background image support

## Version 3.13.0
* Add an option to disable detection and aspect ratio correction of official raspberry pi displays
* BUGFIX: setting 12h format from the http interface didn't work
* Internal refactoring and code cleanup

## Version 3.12.1
* BUGFIX: missing colon from default clock.ini for port 80

## Version 3.12.0
* Add support for 12 hour format on time-of-day display

## Version 3.11.1
* LTC Bugfix, we had a wrong audio device in the default configuration

## Version 3.11.0
* LTC added options:
  * Toggle between frames and seconds on the clock ring
  * Toggle for loss of signal handling; either blank the clock or continue on internal time
  * Toggle for disabling the LTC handling
* Images
  * Build raspberry pi 2 compatible images
  * Use config file generated by the build automation

## Version 3.10.2
* LTC reception & Hifiberry ADC+ DAC Pro
  * Bugfix on sdl-clock to display the hour part of LTC timestamp
  * Added configuration for the hifiberry to the sd-card image

## Version 3.10.1
* Little more black space between dual clock text display "pixels"


## Version 3.10.0
* Add /clock/dual/text OSC message for setting a text field on dual clock mode

## Version 3.9.0
* Build automation:
  * Build one unified image
* Clock:
  * Web configuration interface
  * Dual-clock mode

## Version 3.8.2
* Build automation improvements
  * Read version information from runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo()
  * Include pimoroni hyperpixel4 square display support

## Version 3.8.0
* multi-clock: Implement new display of up to 40 clocks
* config file support: use -C to read config flags from a file
* osx support: Remove unused rpi gpio stuff from sdl-clock and handle sdl2 events

## Version 3.7.1
* clock-bridge:
  * BUGFIX: Millumin osc tally and layer renaming. Renaming an active layer caused the internal state to become corrupt. The clock-bridge now filters layer states that haven't been updated in 1 second to remove ghost layers from the renames.

## Version 3.7.0
* BUGFIX: Correct the monitor pixel aspect ratio on the official raspberry pi display. The clock is now round instead of oval.
* FEATURE: Detect if a monitor is rotated 90 or 270 degrees and move the clock to the top portion of the screen.

## Version 3.6.2
* BUGFIX: Make /clock/time/set timezone aware.

## Version 3.6.1
* BUGFIX: /clock/time/set OSC command and busybox date command.

## Version 3.6.0
* Adds /clock/time/set osc command for setting system time, see README.md for details

## Version 3.5.1
* BUFIX: build issue on 3.5.0

## Version 3.5.0
* OSC commands for hiding/showing the numerical seconds field
  * /clock/seconds/off - hides the second display
  * /clock/seconds/on - shows the second display
* Add --debug command line parameter to enable verbose logging

## Version 3.4.1
* Greatly reduced the amount of logging that gets printed on the console. This caused slowdowns on raspberry pi

## Version 3.4.0
* Automatically rescan network interfaces and addresses every 5 seconds
  * This removes the race condition with dhcp lease on startup
  * Now if feedback address is 255.255.255.255 the feedback is sent to broadcast on all configured ipv4 interfaces
* Added --disable-feedback command line switch
  * This disables the osc feedback but the clock will still listen for osc commands

## Version 3.3.0
* Add --disable-osc command line parameter

## Version 3.2.0
* Implemented resolution scaling.
  * This adds support for the official raspberry pi 7" display
* Fixes to the 192x192 small mode

## Version 3.1.1rc1
* CI environment now builds raspberry pi sd card images

## Version 3.1.0
* Clock now shows its version number before acquiring the correct time

## Version 3.0.2
* BUGIX: "tally" text formatting for /qmsk/clock/count osc messages

## Version 3.0.1
* Implement CI environment for testing and automated builds

## Version 3.0.0
* Breaking change to OSC feedback, clocks now send paused/running state
* Countdowns can now be paused and resumed with /clock/pause and /clock/resume

## Version 2.1.0
* Disable flashing when countdown reaches zero with --flash=0 parameter
* Print version to console when started

## Version 2.0.0
* Added countdown and count up timer modes
* Added OSC commands for timers
* Added OSC feedback of clock mode and display date
