# OSC controlled simple clock

This is a simplistic clock written in go that can be used either as a video out with SDL or as a dedicated clock buidt with a 32x32 pixel hub75 led matrix and a ring of 60 addressable leds.

## SDL clock

You can build the clock binary with `go get gitlab.com/Depili/clock-8001/cmd/sdl_clock`. Compiling requires SDL 2 and SDL_GFX 2 libraries. On the raspberry pi the default libraries shipped with rasbian will only output data to X11 window, so for full screen dedicated clock you need to compile the SDL libraries from source. For compiling use `./configure --host=armv7l-raspberry-linux-gnueabihf --disable-pulseaudio --disable-esd --disable-video-mir --disable-video-wayland --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-opengl` for config flags.

## Dedicated led matrix clock

Bill of materials:
* Raspberry pi
* 32x32 pixel 4mm pixel pitch led matrix
* Led ring with 60 ws2812b leds
* Arduino (nano recommend)
* Adapter hat for the raspberry pi to connect to the led matrix
* 5V 3A power supply
* 12 leds of your choice for the static "hour" markers and current limiting resistors

You need to compile https://gitlab.com/Depili/rpi-matrix for a small program that will listen on udp socket for the led matrix data and handle driving the led matrix.

Compile the led matrix clock binary with `go get gitlab.com/Depili/clock-8001/cmd/clock`
